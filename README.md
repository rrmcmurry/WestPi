## Overview

This repository contains the Raspberry Pi coprocessor code for our test robots. 

Note: The code for the RoboRIO is maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/rrmcmurry/9668_Swerve/).


## Repository Structure

- `/`: Contains the current version of the raspberry pi code that can be uploaded and run on WPILibPi as an application
- `/Archive`: Contains earlier versions of the raspberry pi code that could be uploaded and run on WPILibPi as an application
- `/ComputerPythonExamples`: Contains test python code that can be run in Python from windows to test OpenCV and apriltag detection
- `/Raspberrypi WPILib imag`: Locally contains copies of the Raspberrypi images obtained from the [WPILibPi repository](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi/releases). 
These files are not uploaded to github to save space. We are currently using the 2024.1.1 Beta version of WPILibPi.

## Getting Involved

This repository is maintained by **Robby McMurry**, a robotics mentor who is diving into the world of robotics with a passion to learn.

Feel free to contribute or raise issues as we continuously improve our robot's performance!
